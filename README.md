# What does a Junior Sysadmin need to know?

With the guidance of a good mentor, only three key skills are required for a junior sysadmin. It is not how to restart a webserver, or how Linux manages memory. Whether or not the junior admin can answer classic interview question "Can you explain what happens when you request a webpage in your browser?" is not important. With the exception of perhaps a bit of familiarity with the command line, there are only really three things a junior admin needs to know.

## How to research

A junior sysadmin will be told over and over to "read the man pages" (usually by less-than-effective mentors), and while they *should*, it is unlikely that the junior admin will have the context to fully understand what they are reading at first. Knowing how to research is an important part of the junior admin role. Read the help output of the command. If that does not help, read the man pages. If that does not help, search the internet; help forums, tutorials, even enthusiast blogs will at least provide context and usually someone has already had the same issue and written up a solution. Being able to research how something works is the first step in learning complex technologies and building technical skills and experience.

## How to test

Knowing how to test is key for a junior systems administrator. Points are given for even knowing to test in the first place, and being good at testing is a skill that can be learned over time. However, knowing the basics of how to test changes is crucial. Regardless of the technology being used - whether writing a script, configuring a webserver, or troubleshooting a storage problem - effective testing has the same core pieces.

1. Trial and error: it is important for a junior sysadmin to read through the documentation or man pages of whatever technology they are working with, but frequently, documentation is lacking. Even when it is not, absorbing knowledge will come easier with trial and error. Effective testing leads to better understanding.

2. One test at a time: with complex systems, the final result may not be attainable without multiple changes, but for effective testing only one change can be made at a time. Making multiple changes clouds the effect each change has and makes it harder to know what change does what.

3. Observe and record: There is more to testing than making a change, checking if the problem is resolved, and trying again. Follow  what actually happens: watch logs, observe behavior, and take notes. Understanding comes from seeing how, not just if, a change impacts function. Recording results is just as critical. After dozens of changes, it is hard to pinpoint what did what without good notes. The worst tests are the ones that have to be repeated because the results were lost.

Effective testing will cement how things work into the junior admin's brain, and there will be copious notes to reference for any concepts that don't quite make it. Best of all, it will be in their own words, and easier to cross-reference in the future.

## How to ask for help

As important as research and testing on their own is, though, just as important to a junior admin is knowing to ask for help when they do become stuck. A good mentor will not expect a junior admin to have all the answers, or indeed even the context to get started sometimes. While it is important for them to try to figure out an issue on their own, spending too much time on a single problem to the exclusion of other work or struggling so much that they become frustrated and distracted is counterproductive. A junior admin should take a crack at the issue, research it and work through it, but know when to call it and ask for help. Bonus points for asking for guidance on clearing the specific hurdle rather than having a mentor show them how to fix the entire problem all at once.

There is nothing special about being a systems administrator. There is no knowledge that anyone could not learn and no technical skills that *prove* a junior admin. Far more important are the "soft skills" of knowing how to learn, how to test, and how and when to ask for help. Junior administrators who possess the skills here will have no trouble picking up technical skills, and more importantly, no trouble being useful and contributing members of their teams.
